# Paytm-Project
This project is a Paytm Clone Front-End Web Application developed using HTML and CSS. The purpose of the project is to replicate the visual layout and structure of the Paytm homepage, including navigation, banners, and recharge services.




The navigation bar is placed at the top of the page and contains the Paytm logo, main service links such as Recharge & Bills and Ticket Booking, and a Sign In button.The Paytm logo and color scheme are used to closely match the original platform’s branding.Below the navigation bar, a large promotional banner is displayed to highlight offers or important services. The banner is centrally aligned and styled with rounded corners, making it visually attractive and consistent with modern UI design standards used in payment applications.




The recharge section is the core functional area of the page and showcases different services such as mobile recharge, DTH recharge, FASTag recharge, electricity bill payment, and loan EMI payment.A right-side banner is included next to the recharge section to promote additional services or offers.The entire project uses a single CSS file to manage spacing, fonts, colors, borders, and shadows. Techniques such as flexbox, border radius, and box shadow are used to create a modern and visually appealing interface while keeping the code clean and organized.




This project is purely a static front-end clone and does not include backend functionality such as user authentication, real payments, or database integration. However, it provides a strong foundation for adding JavaScript and backend technologies in future enhancements.It is suitable for academic mini-projects, portfolio showcases, and beginners learning front-end web development concepts.
